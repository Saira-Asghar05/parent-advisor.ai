Wash the broccoli and carrots. Cut the broccoli into florets and peel the carrots, then cut them into sticks or slices of similar size to ensure even cooking.\\n2. Heat a large pan or wok over medium-high heat and add enough oil to coat the bottom.\\n3. If using garlic, add it to the pan and sauté for about 30 seconds until aromatic.\\n4. Add the carrots to the pan first, as they take longer to cook than the broccoli. Sauté for a few minutes until they start to soften.\\n5. Add the broccoli florets to the pan and continue to sauté. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender but still have a bit of crunch.
